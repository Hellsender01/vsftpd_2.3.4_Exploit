**CVE-2011-2523**

# Discription
- vsftpd, which stands for `Very Secure FTP Daemon`,is an FTP server for Unix-like systems, including Linux. It is licensed under the GNU General Public License. It supports IPv6 and SSL.

- In July 2011, it was discovered that vsftpd version 2.3.4 downloadable from the master site had been compromised.  Users logging into a compromised vsftpd-2.3.4 server may issue a `:)` smileyface as the username and gain a command shell on port `6200`.  This was not an issue of a security hole in vsftpd, instead, someone had uploaded a different version of vsftpd which contained a backdoor. Since then, the site was moved to Google App Engine.
